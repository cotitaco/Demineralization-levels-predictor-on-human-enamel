# Demineralization-levels-predictor-on-human-enamel
First let me guide you through the clinical background.

After arthodontics treatment (glueing braces to the teeth and after some years, taking bracess off th teeth) tooth's enamel has always a certain degree of demineralization, lask of minerals in the enamel. One specific treatment that has been proven to work and improve tooth's health is apply ClinPro paste once every week for one month or 2 months depending on the demineralization degree. This treatment when followed correclty has shown magnifiscent results on REMINERALIZATION (the opposite of demineralization)

My job in this script was to create a matematical model using linear regression to predict after a certain amount of product applications, what demineralizaion levels will teeth have.
